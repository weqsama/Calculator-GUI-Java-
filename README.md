Hi! This is my first ever *real* coding project, a simple calculator app with the following basic capabilities:
- Simple arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %);
- Trig functions and their variations (sinx, cosx, tanx | asinx, acosx, atanx | hsinx, hcosx, htanx)
- Logarithms, exponentials, roots, and absolute value
- Extra things for functionality
