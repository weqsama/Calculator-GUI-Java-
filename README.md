Hi! This is my first ever *real* coding project, a simple calculator app built by me using Java + Swing tools
with the following basic capabilities:

- Simple arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %);
- Trig functions and their variations (sinx, cosx, tanx | asinx, acosx, atanx | hsinx, hcosx, htanx)
- Logarithms, exponentials, roots, and absolute value
- Extra buttons for functionality (backspace, clear, exit)

This project introduced me to GUI development and was a large first step in being able to create more polished and user-friendly applications.
